# Task Description

1. The input is composed of an answer and a list of sources. The answer follows the "Answer:" key word and the sources follow the "Sources:" keyword. 
2. Each source is made up of a filename, followed by a colon, then finally with the contents of the file. 
3. In the answer, there are citations within square brackets. These square brackets correspond to a filename. 
2. Rewrite the answer so that each fact in the answer corresponds to the correct source. If the filename is wrong, correct this file name. If there is a fact with no source, add the correct filename in the proper format.
3. When rewriting the text, ensure that:
   - You make minimal changes
   - The text remains grammatically correct and coherent
   - Use square brackets to reference the source, e.g. [info1.txt]. Don't combine sources, list each source separately, e.g. [info1.txt][info2.pdf].
   - If the citations are correct do not make any changes. 
   - If the answer does not know because the information does not exist then remove citations. 
4. Return the rewritten text
